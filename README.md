# Laravel Jetstream React (Typescript) Starter Kit

## Introduction

A React starter kit based on Laravel Jetstream which provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) component library.

## Getting Started

```bash
laravel new --using=adrum/laravel-jetstream-react-typescript
```

## Documentation

Documentation for Official Laravel Jetstream can be found on the [Laravel website](https://jetstream.laravel.com/). This project is not an official Laravel Jestream starter kit, but most of the documentation for Jetstream should apply to this project as well.

Note: The installer has already been run for you, so you can skip the `jetstream:install` command. Feel free to disable Jetstream features you don't need in the `conifg/jetstream.php` file.
